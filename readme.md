# goalchords
## visualizing the frequency of player's involvement in goals

The code has two parts, the first (dataMapper) is reading the goal data from a csv file, doing some data mapping/transformation tasks to get the info into the format (square matrix) required by D3. The second part (dataVisualizer) renders the chord diagram as svg.

I made this with goal data from the Pittsburgh Penguins, but the code will work for any team, given you provide a csv file formatted like the csv file in the data folder.
